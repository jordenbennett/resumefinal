    <p class="box1 tbcenter"> I am an ambitious and goal-driven. I find the most satisfaction when what <br>
    I am doing is inline with accomplishing my goals. I always create new goals. <br>
    I recently have made some summer goals. This summer I want to improve my golf skills. <br>
    This is for the sport of golf, but also because of business. I can make some quality <br>
    business connections when I play golf, and play it well. I also have a goal to make <br>
    $130,000 this summmer selling solar here in Utah. I have fitness goals to go to the gym <br>
    and lift weights every single day. I want to stay around 175-180 pounds. </p>

    <p class="box1 tbcenter"> I have a girlfriend named Kate. She is literally the best. <br>
    She is an important example me in so many ways. She is a spiritual giant. She is very driven for success. <br>
    Her confidence blows me away. Her beauty on the outside makes me smile every time I see her, <br>
    and her beauty on the inside resonates virtue. I love it. I love her. Also her eyes are fine. </p>
